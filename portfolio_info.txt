# Portfolio Project Structure & End-to-End Explanation

This document provides a comprehensive, line-by-line and function-by-function breakdown of the Hassan Portfolio project. It is designed to allow any LLM or developer to fully understand the architecture, design choices, and interactive logic of the application.

---

## 📁 File Structure Overview
- `index.html`: The main structural entry point.
- `css/styles.css`: Core layout, typography, and premium UI styling.
- `css/theme-engine.css`: The "Brain" of the multi-theme system (Antigravity v1.0).
- `js/theme-manager.js`: Logic for theme switching and persistence.
- `js/theme-picker.js`: UI logic for the circular theme selector dropdown.
- `js/hero-background.js`: High-performance interactive background mesh (GPU optimized).
- `js/main.js`: Main application logic (Typing effect, Scroll Reveal, Form handling, Reviews system).

## 📄 index.html (The Foundation)
The HTML structure is semantic and optimized for SEO/Accessibility.

### Head Section (Lines 1–16)
- **Line 6**: Sets `viewport` for mobile responsiveness.
- **Line 7**: Meta description for SEO ("Python Django & AI Automation Developer").
- **Lines 11–12**: Links to the core `styles.css` and the dynamic `theme-engine.css`.
- **Line 15**: Font Awesome integration for premium iconography.

### Body & Navigation (Lines 18–59)
- **Line 20**: `bg-canvas`: Fixed background layer for mouse-following particle animations (managed in `main.js`).
- **Line 23–59**: Fixed Header.
    - **Lines 26–31**: Navigation links with smooth-scroll hash targeting.
    - **Line 32**: Admin Login button for triggers the Reviews management modal.
    - **Lines 36–52**: `theme-picker-wrapper`: Placeholder for the dynamic theme selector UI.
    - **Line 54–58**: Hamburger menu for mobile navigation.

### Hero Section (Lines 62–79)
- **Line 64**: `hero-gradient-canvas`: The specialized canvas for the high-end interactive mesh gradient (managed in `hero-background.js`).
- **Line 67**: Main H1 branding.
- **Line 68**: `typewriter-text`: Target for the JS-driven typing animation.
- **Line 72–75**: Call-to-action buttons (stacked vertically on mobile via CSS).

### About Section (Lines 81–114)
- **Lines 87–96**: Premium Profile Design. Uses a nested frame system (`profile-orbit`, `profile-glow`) for a 3D orbital animation effect around the profile picture.
- **Lines 98–112**: Professional bio focusing on Python, Django, and n8n.

### Skills Section (Lines 119–135)
- Uses a flex-grid of "Skill Badges". Each badge uses Font Awesome icons and has high-end hover states.

### Projects Section (Lines 138–219)
- **Grid Layout**: Displays project cards.
- **Card Structure**: Image -> Tech Tags -> Description -> Action Links (GitHub/Contact).

### Reviews Section (Lines 222–279)
- **Lines 229**: Dynamic container where client reviews are injected via `main.js`.
- **Lines 240–279**: `review-modal`: A pop-up form allowing users to submit ratings (1-5 stars) and feedback.

### Contact Section (Lines 307–359)
- **Line 315**: Web3Forms integration key for serverless form submissions.
- **Lines 329–344**: Custom phone input with country code picker and validation.

### Footer & Scripts (Lines 362–386)
- **Lines 377–382**: Script loading order is critical. Theme Manager must load before the UI scripts to ensure a "flash-free" theme application.

---

## 🎨 css/theme-engine.css (The "Antigravity" Engine)
Total lines: 778. This is a non-destructive multi-theme system.

### Base Variables (:root)
- Defines CSS variables (Tokens) for `--bg-primary`, `--accent-primary`, etc.
- All core colors are mapped here.

### Theme Definitions ([data-theme="..."])
- 10+ unique themes (Soft Blues, Sage, Deep Black, etc.).
- Each theme overrides the core tokens, instantly changing the entire site's look without reloading.

### Universal Mappings (Lines 418+)
- Uses `!important` mappings to ensure that when a data-attribute is present on `<html>`, it overrides any hardcoded styles in `styles.css`. This is why themes feel so "deep" and consistent.

## ⚡ js/hero-background.js (High-Performance Canvas)
This file handles the premium mesh gradient in the Hero section.

- **`AntigravityHeroBackground` Class**:
    - **`getThemeColors()`**: Reads CSS variables directly from the browser's computed style, making the animation's colors change dynamically when the theme changes.
    - **`createParticles()`**: Spawns a grid of points (mesh).
    - **`updateParticles()`**: Logic for mouse attraction/repulsion. Uses a "float back" algorithm so particles return to their original grid position when the mouse leaves.
    - **`drawMesh()`**: Connects nearby particles with thin, themed lines and draws a radial gradient "spotlight" at the mouse position.

---

## 🧠 js/main.js (Application Logic)
This is the largest file, containing the functional "A-Z" logic.

### Key Functional Blocks:
1.  **Background Canvas (Mouse Particles)**: Draws the small following dots that leave a trail as you move the mouse across the whole site.
2.  **Typing Effect**: Cycles through an array of professional titles for the Hero H1 subtitle.
3.  **Scroll Reveal**: Uses `IntersectionObserver` to trigger the `.visible` class (fade-up animation) as sections enter the viewport.
4.  **Admin Login System**:
    - Fetches credentials from `login.txt`.
    - Securely enables "Admin Mode" in `sessionStorage` allowing the user to delete/edit reviews.
5.  **Reviews System (CRUD Logic)**:
    - **`loadReviews()`**: Retrieves reviews from `localStorage`.
    - **`saveReview()`**: Persists new submissions.
    - **`addReviewToGrid()`**: Dynamically builds the HTML for a review card, including star icons and edit/delete buttons if in admin mode.
6.  **Contact Form Validation**:
    - Real-time email regex checking.
    - Phone number cleaning (removes spaces/dashes).
    - Asynchronous `fetch` call to Web3Forms API.

## 🎨 css/styles.css (Core Design System)
- **Lines 4–19**: Defines the "Professional Default" variables.
- **Lines 345–468**: The complex About Me animations. Uses `@keyframes float` and `@keyframes rotateClockwise` to create the orbital glow effect.
- **Lines 969+ (Media Queries)**: 
    - **Camon 30 / Small Phone Fixes**: Enforces `flex-direction: column` on buttons and centers the About Me layout for widths < 480px.
    - **Responsive Typography**: Scales H1 fonts from `4rem` (Desktop) down to `2.2rem` (Mobile).

---

## ⚙️ Persistent Data & States
- **localStorage**: Stores the selected `theme-id` and the `client_reviews` array.
- **sessionStorage**: Stores `is_admin` state to keep the admin session alive until the browser is closed.
- **URL Parameters**: Supports `?admin=true` for developer entry into the login modal.
